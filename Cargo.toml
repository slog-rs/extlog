# Cargo doesn't let you publish crates with circular dev dependencies,
# so in order to publish new versions you'll need to temporarily comment out
# this dependency in your local codebase and publish the crate using the
# --allow-dirty flag.
#
# This is a known problem in Cargo - see
# https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/4242 for tracking issue.
